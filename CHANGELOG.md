# Changelog

All notable changes to tree-sitter-vba will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- A `vbscript` parser generated from the same grammar core as `vba` and `vb6`.
  `vbscript/grammar.js` is a one-line entry point; the dialect is the
  `isVBScript` branches in `common/define-grammar.js`, which add statements at
  the top level, `class_declaration` with `end_class_statement`, and
  `default_modifier`, and remove the VBA constructs VBScript lacks (types and
  type characters, `Declare`, conditional compilation, jumps and labels, file
  I/O, events, named arguments, `Like`, date literals). The `vba` and `vb6`
  `grammar.json` and `parser.c` are byte-identical before and after, and the
  `vba` trees for the 481 examples are unchanged. 38 corpus cases under
  `vbscript/test/corpus/`. Classic ASP embedding is out of scope; see
  [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-vbscript-is-a-subset-entry-point.md).
- Gate the built browser parser artifact at 7,864,320 bytes in CI, in the
  release workflow, and in the Pages deployment before `playground/dist` is
  uploaded, below the 8MB buffer above which Chromium refuses a main-thread
  `WebAssembly.Instance` and `Language.load()` fails. The check reports every
  artifact's size on every run, and covers a further dialect artifact without
  further configuration.
- A `vb6` parser generated from the same grammar core as `vba`. The statement
  grammar lives once in `common/define-grammar.js`; `vba/grammar.js` and
  `vb6/grammar.js` are thin entry points and generated sources move to
  `vba/src/` and `vb6/src/`. `vb6` adds the `.frm`/`.ctl`/`.cls` headers as
  written by the VB6 IDE, graphics statements, VB6-only comment continuation,
  and an external scanner distinguishing a spaced from an immediate member
  operator. The npm addon, the Go module and the Wasm artifact remain the
  `vba` parser.
- The provenance of a 1,436-file VB6 acceptance corpus (`corpus/MANIFEST.md`,
  `corpus/FILES.tsv`, `scripts/fetch-corpus.mjs`) and `scripts/parse-corpus.mjs`
  to measure it. The corpus is fetched, not vendored.
- `scripts/compare-cst.mjs` diffs the trees of all 481 example files between a
  reference checkout and the working tree, positions stripped, and classifies
  every differing hunk by node type.

### Changed

- Report browser consumer load failures from the browser's own error state.
  The fixture page publishes the last completed initialization stage, whether
  initialization failed, and the outcome of the most recent parse, and the
  real-browser smoke test raises those states, console errors, page errors,
  and failing asset requests as soon as any of them appears.
- The `vba` grammar is the base grammar plus the `bang_identifier` node in
  declarations and the omitted-argument fix below. Constructs the VB6 corpus
  needed and VBA also accepts (`Let`, `LSet`/`RSet`, `GoSub`/`Return`,
  `On Local Error`, `Global`, `Dim WithEvents`, `ReDim x(n) As T`, octal
  literals, `AddressOf Module.Procedure`, chained comparisons, `#If` around
  `Case` clauses, and the Single `!` suffix in expression positions) are `vb6`
  only; see ADR 0005. The `vba` parse table returns to 15,317 states from
  21,995 and the browser artifact to 7.57 MB from 11.28 MB.
- In `vb6`, an indexed or property target on the left of `=` is an assignment.

### Fixed

- Bare calls with three or more arguments keep their callee. A per-item dynamic
  precedence on omitted-argument lists rewarded the reading that split
  `CallByName a, b, c, d` into the expression statement `CallByName` followed
  by a call to `a`, in 131 of the 481 example files, while every file still
  parsed without `ERROR`. Regression cases pin `CallByName`, procedure calls,
  member calls and `Err.Raise` structurally.
- `arr(i) = x > 0` and `.Prop(x) = y > 0` are assignments again in `vba`.
  Admitting chained comparisons made the call reading viable and it won the
  tie; the chain is now `vb6` only.
- An omitted-argument list, or a list continued on a line that begins with a
  comma, stays under one callee (`X , , a`, `Foo a, b, , c, d`,
  `obj.M "s", , 10`, `Foo a _ / , b`). The base ended the call at the comma and
  parsed the rest as a separate statement. Six example files change shape.

### Documented

- Define the browser loading size limit, the gate value, and why the gate sits
  below the limit in the browser artifact contract.

## [v0.13.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Add explicit `Write #` statement support, including empty, single-value,
  multi-value, and mixed-separator output lists.
- Add shared public `output_list` and `char_position` CST nodes for
  Print-family output syntax.

### Changed

- Represent output values for `Debug.Print`, `?`, unparenthesized `Print`
  methods, `Print #`, and `Write #` through `output_list`. Print-method
  `call_statement.arguments` may now contain this node instead of an ordinary
  call argument list. This is an intentional pre-1.0 CST change.

### Fixed

- Parse trailing semicolon and comma output-position controls in Print-family
  statements without allowing semicolons as general VBA statement separators.
- Preserve call expressions, member chains, comparisons, binary expressions,
  `Spc(...)`, and `Tab(...)` as output values.

### Documented

- Define the Print-family CST field contract and the corresponding xlflow
  consumer migration requirements.

## [v0.12.2] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Add a minimal self-contained browser consumer example for the WebAssembly
  parser, including `ERROR` and `MISSING` recovery reporting.

### Documented

- Define the supported browser Wasm artifact, release versioning, runtime
  compatibility, and downstream loading contract.

### Fixed

- Parse exported VBA procedure attributes with multi-segment names such as
  `Foo.VB_ProcData.VB_Invoke_Func` without parser recovery nodes.

## [v0.12.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Add a standalone reproducible WebAssembly parser build and publish its Wasm
  artifact with a SHA-256 checksum on versioned GitHub Releases.

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Validate third-party fixture source and license metadata in CI.

### Changed

- Generate the parser with Tree-sitter ABI 15 for contextual reserved-word
  handling.

### Fixed

- Reject `Dim` and `ReDim` as comma-separated variable declarator names and
  expose the invalid remainder through parser recovery while preserving the
  valid declaration prefix.
- Correct three VBE-rejected stdVBA fixture statements to use colon-separated
  VBA statements.

## [v0.11.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Add the MIT-licensed ROneCOne exported class as a real-world parser fixture.

### Fixed

- Parse VBE-exported procedure `Attribute` statements immediately following
  `Function`, `Sub`, and `Property` headers.
- Accept contextual procedure names such as `Load` and `Name` in exported
  attribute targets without changing ordinary identifier parsing. This prevents
  recovery nodes and spurious `Attribute` call sites in downstream consumers.

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Parse conditionally selected procedure headers with branch-local declarations
  and statements through `conditional_branch_body`.
- Parse `Xor`, `Eqv`, and `Imp` condition expressions, assignable `For` and
  `For Each` control variables, assignable `Next` variables, and
  colon-separated inline `Type` members.
- Add regression coverage for conditional-compilation-split `If` constructs,
  indexed-member `ReDim`, whitespace-sensitive and continued implicit-member
  calls, and calls that combine omitted positional arguments with named
  arguments.
- Expand the checked-in real-world corpus to 477 VBA source files.

### Changed

- Represent multiline `If` constructs as the flat `if_statement`,
  `elseif_fragment`, `else_fragment`, and `end_if_fragment` sequence. This is
  an intentional breaking CST change for downstream consumers.
- Allow whitespace-sensitive and omitted-then-named ambiguous calls to use a
  fieldless `call_statement`; consumers must treat `callee` and `arguments` as
  optional for these forms.
- Allow indexed-member `ReDim` targets to use a fieldless `redim_statement`
  while retaining structured declarators for ordinary forms.
- Update highlight queries for the flat `If` fragment nodes and remove
  nested-node `If` folding queries that no longer have a structural range.
- Increase focused corpus coverage from 212 to 222 cases and checked-in
  clean-parse coverage from 343 to 477 files.

### Fixed

- Cleanly parse conditional compilation that selects alternative multiline
  `If` headers while sharing the body and `End If`.
- Cleanly parse real-world implicit calls such as
  `QuickSortKeys .arrKeys, .arrItems, 0, .ub`.
- Cleanly parse omitted positional arguments followed by multiple named
  arguments without producing recovery nodes.

## [v0.10.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Add regression coverage for factored expression rules and equivalent inline
  and multiline control-flow forms, including mixed shared `Next` chains.

### Changed

- Factor common expression, assignable, and control-flow grammar alternatives
  without changing the public CST or reducing the existing clean-parse range.
- Reduce the generated `parser.c` size from 66,446,096 bytes to 63,339,156
  bytes (4.68%), with 927 fewer parser states and 622 fewer large states.

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Parse nested colon-separated single-line `For`, `For Each`, `Do`, `While`,
  and `With` control-flow statements.
- Parse shared `Next` counter lists such as `Next inner, outer` and preserve
  their nested loop structure.
- Preserve every colon-separated statement in a single-line `If` branch through
  `inline_statement_sequence` nodes.

### Changed

- Replace the singular `next_variable` field on `For` and `For Each` with
  `next_variables: next_variable_list`. This is an intentional pre-1.0 CST
  breaking change for downstream consumers.

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Add permanent community regression fixtures for hexadecimal `ChrW` arguments,
  large `Select Case` blocks, inline `ElseIf` branches, and `Mid`/`Mid$`
  assignment and expression forms.
- Add generated `Select Case` parser stress coverage for 10, 50, 100, and 500
  clauses. The test checks recovery nodes and expected tree structure and runs
  as part of `pnpm test`.

### Fixed

- Parse inline statement bodies on `ElseIf` branches within block `If`
  statements.

## [v0.8.1] - 2026-06-19

- Upgrade for cache refresh

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Stabilize downstream-facing AST fields for editor and LSP integrations:
  procedure declarations now expose named `end` terminator nodes, procedure
  static modifiers use the `modifiers` field, member access uses
  `receiver`/`member`, and calls expose arguments through an `arguments` field.
- Split statement-style call arguments into `unparenthesized_argument_list`
  while keeping parenthesized call-expression arguments under `argument_list`.
  This is a breaking tree-shape change for consumers that relied on positional
  call argument traversal or the previous `object`/`property` member fields.
- Stop tracking generated `src/parser.c` and `src/grammar.json` in Git. They
  are ignored locally, generated in CI, and generated during npm `prepack` so
  package tarballs still include the parser artifacts.
- Keep a Go-specific generated parser copy under `bindings/go/parser.c` so Go
  module consumers can build the Go binding from Git tags without relying on
  npm packaging artifacts.
- Skip the native binding install build when generated parser artifacts are not
  present in a development checkout; explicit test and package flows generate
  the parser before building.

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Add parser support for legacy numeric line labels on comment-only and empty
  statement lines, including numbered top-level procedure declarations.
- Add parser support for colon-separated single-line `Do ... Loop`,
  `For ... Next`, `For Each ... Next`, and `With ... End With` blocks.
- Add regression coverage for single-line `If ... Then _` statements continued
  across physical lines.

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- Split property declarations into `property_get_declaration`,
  `property_let_declaration`, and `property_set_declaration` nodes.
- Split external declarations into `declare_sub_statement` and
  `declare_function_statement` nodes.
- Add structural declaration fields and modifier nodes for downstream symbol
  extraction, including visibility, static, `WithEvents`, `PtrSafe`,
  parameter passing mode, optional/default parameter metadata, type clauses,
  and initializers.
- Expose `Implements` targets through a stable `name` field.
- Update bundled highlight, fold, and tag queries for the new declaration node
  shapes.
- Configure the Tree-sitter corpus test npm script to run with `CC=gcc` and
  `CXX=g++`, avoiding Windows parser compilation failures from the wrong
  compiler selection.

## [v0.5.1] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Add `comparison_operator` nodes and `left`, `operator`, and `right` fields
  to `comparison_expression` for easier downstream inspection.
- Add corpus coverage for implicit member call expressions such as `.Method()`,
  `.Factory.Create()`, and leading-bang member chains inside `With` blocks.

### Changed

- Highlight `?` Debug.Print shorthand statements as keywords and highlight
  comparison operators through the dedicated `comparison_operator` node.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Add parser support for `? expr` Debug.Print shorthand statements, including
  comma- and semicolon-separated output arguments, comparison expressions,
  numbered statements, single-line `If` branches, and colon-separated
  statements.

### Changed

- Split visible member access trees into `qualified_member_expression` for
  explicit object access and `implicit_member_expression` for leading-dot or
  leading-bang access, with an `operator` field for `.` and `!`.
- Normalize VBA comparison operators `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `Is`,
  and `Like` under `comparison_expression` while preserving assignment,
  `TypeOf ... Is ...`, and `Case Is ...` parsing behavior.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Add dedicated statement nodes for `RaiseEvent` and `Name oldPath As newPath`.
- Add dedicated statement nodes for classic file I/O statements: `Get #`,
  `Put #`, `Lock`, `Unlock`, `Seek`, and `Reset`.
- Add dedicated statement nodes for `Stop`, `Beep`, `Load`, and `Unload`.
- Add parser support for exponent and abbreviated decimal numeric literals such
  as `1E-3`, `.5`, and `1.`.
- Add identifier type-declaration character support for Currency (`@`) and
  LongLong (`^`).
- Add parser support for old default type declaration statements such as
  `DefInt` and `DefStr`.
- Add Go binding support under `bindings/go`.

### Fixed

- Fix an obvious malformed `Name` rename example in a real-world fixture so
  example parsing continues to validate valid VBA syntax.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Add parser support for Access bang member access such as `rst!Field` and
  mixed dot/bang member chains.
- Add parser support for `Debug.Print`-style semicolon-separated implicit call
  arguments.
- Add parser support for Access report `Line` drawing statements that use
  coordinate ranges such as `Me.Line (x, y)-(x2, y2)`.
- Add support for bare `Shared` file locks in `Open ... For ... Access ...
Shared As ...` statements.
- Add support for dotted `TypeOf ... Is ...` type names whose final segment is
  `Line`, such as `TypeOf ctl Is Access.Line`.
- Add Access-examples, better-access-charts, IguanaTex, and related
  newly bundled third-party parser fixtures with source and license
  attribution.

### Changed

- Expand real-world validation from 262 examples to 343 VBA files.
- Treat `Line` as a valid member/property name in expression chains while
  preserving existing `Line Input #` parsing.

### Fixed

- Fix parse errors in Access and Excel real-world fixtures involving `.Line`
  member chains, bang access, shared file locks, and report drawing syntax.
- Fix an obvious damaged whitespace byte in a non-error third-party fixture
  instead of making the grammar accept invalid source encoding artifacts.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Add parser support for `Event` declarations.
- Add conditional compilation inside `Type` and `Enum` declarations.
- Add conditional procedure headers whose parameter or return types differ
  between `#If`, `#ElseIf`, and `#Else` branches.
- Add computed `On expression GoTo` and `On expression GoSub` statements.
- Add standalone `End`, call-site `ByVal` arguments, and logical comparison
  chains used as values and call arguments.
- Add Currency (`@`) and LongLong (`^`) literal type characters, including
  type characters on hexadecimal literals.
- Add support for colon-separated `Enum` members, single-line empty
  `While ... Wend` loops, and line continuations with trailing whitespace.
- Add VBA-Dictionary, VBA-JSON, VBA-Web, and stdVBA as MIT-licensed real-world
  parser fixtures, with source and license attribution.

### Changed

- Fix parsing of long logical comparison chains in assignments and arguments.
- Fix parsing of large hexadecimal LongLong constants.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-13

### Added

  checked-in VBA examples.
- Add `pnpm query:examples` and include it in `pnpm check` to validate bundled
  highlight, fold, and tag queries against real-world examples.
- Add recovery corpus coverage and broken example fixtures for incomplete calls
  and malformed in-progress code.
- Add parsing support for `Implements`, `Erase`, and common VBA file I/O
  statements: `Open`, `Input #`, `Line Input #`, `Print #`, and `Close`.
- Add tag query captures for labels, numeric labels, and numbered statements.
